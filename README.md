# Game of Life: Step 2

## Introduction
In this step, the initial version of the project created in the first step was improved by splitting the source code into different directories and replacing Makefile with CMake.

## Launch
- Create a CMake-generated project directory by running: `cmake . -B build`
- Set it as current directory: `cd build`
- Run: `make`
- Start the program by compiling the generated binary file: `./gol`

## Terminate
- Press `Ctrl + C`

## Documentation
The docs of this step can be generated by running `make doc` command in the **build** directory which creates a **doc** directory in the source folder. The generated HTML documentation can be viewed by pointing a browser to the *index.html* file in the **doc/html** directory.

## Build
For creating a distribution tar file for this program, `make dist` command in the **build** directory can be used. As a result of this command, a **dist** directory gets created containing the tar file which is free from files generated during compilation.

## Clear
Run `make clear` in the **build** directory to delete all files in the source directory that are created by compiling or building the program.
