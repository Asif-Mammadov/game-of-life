# Game of Life: Step 3 (2 Versions)

## Introduction
In this step, the Game of Life can also be simulated in GUI with SDL2 library. 

## Launch
- Create a CMake-generated project directory by running: `cmake . -B build`
- Set it as current directory: `cd build`
- Run: `make`
- Start the program by compiling the generated binary file with version<sup>1</sup> option: `./gol -v <version>`
- You may also choose the type<sup>2</sup> of the game by option -t.

Example : `./gol -v clipped -t gui`

<sup>1</sup> Parameters for version can be either "circular" or "clipped". Make attention to the spelling.
<sup>2</sup> Parameters for type can be either "terminal" or "gui"

## Terminate
- Press `Ctrl + C`

## Documentation
The docs of this step can be generated by running `make doc` command in the **build** directory which creates a **doc** directory in the source folder. The generated HTML documentation can be viewed by pointing a browser to the *index.html* file in the **doc/html** directory.

## Build
For creating a distribution tar file for this program, `make dist` command in the **build** directory can be used. As a result of this command, a **dist** directory gets created containing the tar file which is free from files generated during compilation.

## Clear
Run `make clear` in the **build** directory to delete all files in the source directory that are created by compiling or building the program.
