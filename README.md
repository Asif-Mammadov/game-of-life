# Game of Life: Step 1

## Introduction
The aim of this step is to create a first draft of code that can be used to visualize the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Launch
- Run `make`
- Start the program by compiling the generated binary file: `./game`

## Terminate
- Press `Ctrl + C`

## Documentation
The docs of this step can be generated by running `make doc` command which creates a **doc** directory in the source folder. The generated HTML documentation can be viewed by pointing a browser to the *index.html* file in the **doc/html** directory.

## Build
For creating a distribution tar file for this program, `make dist` command can be used. As a result of this command, a **dist** directory gets created containing the tar file which is free from files generated during compilation.

## Clean
Run `make clean` to delete all files in the source directory that are created by compiling or building the program.
